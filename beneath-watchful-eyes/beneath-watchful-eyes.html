<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The following essay is based upon my attempt to document my digital trail and interactions with surveillance technology over the course of a single day. I recorded my observations on paper, and have subsequently expanded upon these notes. I also took photographs throughout the day, capturing moments at which I was, in some sense, surveilled. These photos are illustrative rather than exhaustive; I did not capture every instance of surveillance. But they do help demonstrate the extent to which surveillance pervades our&nbsp;lives.</p>

<p>My choice of tools — a pen, paper and a traditional camera — was very deliberate: I did not want the act of recording my digital trail to generate a further, consequent digital trail. By ensuring my tools were not network connected I have avoided creating an unrecordable infinite regression where every attempt to document surveillance was itself&nbsp;surveilled.</p>

<h2>Beneath Watchful&nbsp;Eyes</h2>

<p>The first thing I do most mornings is pick up my phone. On some days my phone is my alarm and I am silencing that, but often this is just habitual checking for notifications. Although an innocuous act, if I continue to use my phone, perhaps by checking social media, my email, or even the weather forecast, I have started creating my daily digital trail. By simply refreshing my feed I let Twitter or Facebook know where I am (via my IP address) and that I am awake. In aggregate even this simple metadata can become very revealing. For instance, logging-in to Facebook at three in the morning might indicate you are having trouble sleeping. If you check Twitter from a different location first thing in the morning than you do later in the day, Twitter can be reasonably confident that they know where you work and where you live, even if you have never provided these locations to&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Even switching on the lights, or boiling the kettle generates a digital trail. Our household, like many in the UK has a &#8216;smart-meter&#8217; and as such every energy use is recorded. Again, once aggregated this data is incredibly divulging. A fairly accurate portrait of life in our house could be painted through the simple metric of electricity and gas consumption: When we wake and when we sleep (lights and heating), when we eat (oven and hob), when we do our laundry (washing machine), and so on. By the time I finish my breakfast my daily digital trail is well&nbsp;underway.</p>

<p>Mid-morning I head to the gym and as my car beeps affirmatively, confirming that my phone has successfully connected to its Bluetooth stereo system, I am reminded that this short journey will create a further digital trail. A smartphone can easily infer when it is connected to a car&#8217;s Bluetooth system, monitor any change in location whilst it is connected, note when it disconnects from that same system, and therefore conclude that a car journey has ended. Indeed this very process is used to provide useful user-facing features, such as marking where you have parked in the Maps application. Although data of this kind does not leave the phone, the act of connecting to the mobile phone network offers no such privacy. Browsing the internet from my phone whilst I am at the gym provides a myriad of advertising networks, trackers and analytics services with data about my approximate location, the device I am using, and more. Over the next hour or so my image is repeatedly captured by the CCTV cameras situated throughout the gym, and I am very aware that I had to scan my membership card on both entrance and exit; it is certainly feasible to monitor how often I visit and how long I&nbsp;stay.</p>

<p>A quick stop at the supermarket on the way home mushrooms my digital trail: I can see myself reflected in the watchful eyes of many further CCTV cameras, meanwhile the act of payment — via a contactless credit-card — provides a record to both the bank and the supermarket of not just my expenditure but my location (I was at this particular supermarket at this particular&nbsp;time).</p>

<p>I spend most of the afternoon reading for the coming week’s lectures and seminars. As I have downloaded and synced the PDF documents to my tablet in advance this alone does not greatly increase my digital trail, at least not beyond my tablet’s own usage monitoring. However as I highlight and annotate the readings, these changes are synced to the cloud, recording the times at which these documents were accessed and&nbsp;edited.</p>

<p>Once I have exhausted my attention for academic reading I reward myself by spending some time gaming. As I connect to Sony’s servers so that I can compete against other players I again know that a ream of information about my activity — my approximate location, the games I play, the time I spend playing those games, and so on — is being&nbsp;collected.</p>

<p>I cook dinner and, as observed earlier, recognise that the resulting the spike in energy usage will be captured by the &#8216;smart-meter&#8217;. After dinner I settle down to watch a movie on Netflix, an obviously surveilled act. Like most technology companies Netflix collect data on their customers to improve their product and inform their decisions. Data collected about my own viewing activity, and users&#8217; viewing activity en masse, drives the recommendation algorithm. This can be a valuable feature; it helps me pick something to watch that I can be confident I will enjoy. But it is a feature that entirely depends upon the monitoring of Netflix&#8217;s&nbsp;users.</p>

<p>As my day draws to a close and I consider what I have learned from paying attention to my digital trail, my focus is again drawn to my phone. The emergence of smartphones ensures that most of us willingly keep an incredibly sophisticated surveillance device on our person at all times. From its network connection and GPS continuously monitoring our location to its microphones continuously listening for activation phrases (such as &#8216;Hey Siri…&#8217; or &#8216;Ok Google…&#8217;), the smartphone is the perfect locus for surveillance. The latest version of iOS (Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system) has a feature called &#8216;Screen Time&#8217; that lets you review your daily and weekly usage of your phone. Intended to help you manage the addictive qualities of smartphones the feature also gives an insight into how revealing our usage of these devices is. I can see graphs recording how often I picked up my phone, how many notifications I received, how much time I spent looking at my phone and in which apps this time was spent. Even though this data is kept privately and securely on my phone, it does provide a stark reminder of how much information we generate about ourselves through our interactions with&nbsp;technology.</p>
